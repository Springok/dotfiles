## Tools

### Zsh
[Z shell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)
> The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh.

### Zim
[zimfw/zimfw: Zim: Modular, customizable, and blazing fast Zsh framework](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw)
> Zim is a Zsh configuration framework that bundles aÂ [plugin manager](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw#usage), usefulÂ [modules](https://zimfw.sh/docs/modules/), and a wide variety ofÂ [themes](https://zimfw.sh/docs/themes/), without compromising onÂ [speed](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/wiki/Speed).

### Neovim
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
> Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives fromÂ [Stevie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_%28text_editor%29)). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.

### Tmux
[Getting Started Â· tmux/tmux Wiki](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Getting-Started)
> tmux is a program which runs in a terminal and allows multiple other terminal programs to be run inside it. Each program inside tmux gets its own terminal managed by tmux, which can be accessed from the single terminal where tmux is running - this called multiplexing and tmux is a terminal multiplexer.

### stow
[Stow - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
[Documentation (Stow)](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/html_node/index.html)

> GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem, and makes them appear to be installed in the same place. For example,Â `/usr/local/bin`Â could contain symlinks to files withinÂ `/usr/local/stow/emacs/bin`,Â `/usr/local/stow/perl/bin`Â etc., and likewise recursively for any other subdirectories such asÂ `.../share`,Â `.../man`, and so on.

### asdf
[asdf-vm/asdf: Extendable version manager with support for Ruby, Node.js, Elixir, Erlang & more](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
> asdf is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis. It is likeÂ `gvm`,Â `nvm`,Â `rbenv`Â &Â `pyenv`Â (and more) all in one! Simply install your language's plugin!

### fzf
[junegunn/fzf: A command-line fuzzy finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
> fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
> It's an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.

### ripgrep
[BurntSushi/ripgrep: ripgrep recursively searches directories for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
> ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### bat
[sharkdp/bat: A cat(1) clone with wings.](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
> AÂ _cat(1)_Â clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.

### zoxide
[ajeetdsouza/zoxide: A smarter cd command. Supports all major shells.](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
>zoxide is aÂ **smarter cd command**, inspired by z and autojump.
>It remembers which directories you use most frequently, so you can "jump" to them in just a few keystrokes.

### exa
[exa Â· a modern replacement for ls](https://the.exa.website/)
> **exa**Â is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary.

### wget
[Wget - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
> GNU Wget is aÂ [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw)Â package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS, the most widely used Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be called from scripts,Â `cron`Â jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

### httpie

- [HTTPie 3.2.1 (latest) docs](https://httpie.io/docs/cli)
Â > Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. HTTPie is designed for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with APIs & HTTP servers.

### tig
