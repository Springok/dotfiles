## FAQ

I saw the `proj` folder in some aliases mappings in `.zshrc`, what is it?
> `~/proj` is my personal preference to store the projects from work, life, it is not configurable at the moment, sorry about that.


I saw the `vm` / `wscript` folders in some aliases mappings in `.zshrc`, what are they?
> `vm` is a private project, own by our team, it contains many helpers related to our main project, and `wscript` is my private project, which is not ready to be public now, feel free remove these aliases, likewise `vim-abagile.git` is our private project too, feel free remove it from the list of vim plugins.


Do I have to clone the `dotfiles` repository to the home directory(`~`)?
> Yep, because I use `stow` as the softlink manager, and most of these configs, should be putted in the home directory,  by default, invoke `stow`  in the `~/dotfiles` , will put these configs to the parent of current folder, which is home directory `~` .
